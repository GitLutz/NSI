# The National Structure Inventory

## Abstract
Structure inventories are an important component of risk analyses, but the United States has lacked a comprehensive, accurate, and publicly available national inventory of structures that includes vulnerability attributes required for risk assessment.  The USACE in partnership with others has sought to fill this gap. Starting in 2011 USACE began developing the first National Structure Inventory (NSI), developed for use by USACE to drive dam safety modeling, levee safety modeling, and real time consequences through the Corps Water Management System (CWMS) National Implementation. The original NSI was created by translating Census-based block-level data from FEMAâ€™s Hazus, a public domain source, into a format where points represented individual structures.  Accurate point-feature structures increase the precision, performance, and resolution or risk analysis when combined with detailed hazard data. USACE and FEMA subsequently improved the location of vulnerable structures and daytime population assignments in the NSI. In 2019, a more systematic update was undertaken to improve the quality of the data: NSI 2.0 leverages commercially available parcel attributes related to vulnerability and Microsoft Bing footprints to offer a marked improvement in structure location. The use of commercial attribute data came at the cost of restricting access to NSI 2.0 data to federal-use-only. Moving forward, the NSI team is exploring open attribute sources to allow access to NSI 2.0 for state, local, tribal, and territorial governments in the short run and full public access in the long run. This paper will outline our journey, discuss the quality of the data, describe current and future applications, and propose a path to a fully open dataset.

## Introduction/Background

### Purpose
Describe the purpose and use cases of the NSI
### Historic Versions
Describe historic releases 2011, 2016, 2018 and briefly describe feature enhancements and changes in data sources/restrictions
### API?
Describe the API
## Need for a National Structure Inventory
Clearly articulate why something like this is needed - maybe an example from Laura, Sandy or Puerto Rico?
### Requirements for an acceptable NSI
Define requirements to make NSI applicable for all hazards and for emergency managment planning.
## Moving Forward
